# Smart Contract Research Lab

A structured repository focused on Solidity engineering, EVM internals,
gas behavior, and smart contract security research.

This project serves as a controlled environment for experimentation,
benchmarking, and low-level analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine behavior.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Explore EVM mechanics at the opcode level
- Measure gas costs under controlled conditions
- Study Solidity compiler behavior
- Analyze storage layout and memory patterns
- Research common vulnerability classes
- Validate optimization strategies empirically

This is not a beginner tutorial repository.
